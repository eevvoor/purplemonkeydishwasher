<p class="ltx_p">In this paper we present an open source implementation for Finnish
morphological parser. We shortly evaluate it against contemporary criticism
towards monolithic and unmaintainable finite-state language description. We
use it to demonstrate way of writing finite-state language description that is
used for varying set of projects, that typically need morphological analyser,
such as POS tagging, morphological analysis, hyphenation, spell checking and
correction, rule-based machine translation and syntactic analysis. The
language description is done using available open source methods for building
finite-state descriptions coupled with autotools-style build system, which is
de facto standard in open source projects.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Writing maintainable language descriptions for finite-state systems has
traditionally been a laborious task. Even though finite-state technology has
been de facto standard for writing computational language descriptions for more
than two decades now <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">beesley/2003</span>]</cite>, it has some recognised flaws and
problems both caused by shortcomings of actual implementations and
background technology <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">wintner/2008</span>]</cite>. Commonly language description is
performed by a single linguist or language technologist. The descriptions
typically wind up being complex enough that modifying them requires a great
amount of studying and understanding before one is able to do the smallest of
modifications to the system. In the current times that all proper, healthy,
scientific projects should be open source and globally developed, this poses a
challenge for such project’s internal structure. Another source of problem in
such collaboration is that background of contributors for language description
varies from computer scientists to linguists <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">maxwell/2008</span>]</cite> to
computer-savvy native language speakers, all of whom should be able to
contribute to the project. The solutions we propose for this is to embrace
proper modularisation in language descriptions to allow multiple specific
entry points to contributors.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In this paper we describe a new implementation of the Finnish language
description called omorfi<span class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup>http://home.gna.org/omorfi</span></span></span>, made to support
large variety of NLP applications and different audiences. While the
background theory for implementing finite-state description of Finnish was laid
out already in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">koskenniemi/1983</span>]</cite>, and morphophonological system
doesn’t have significant changes, the actual system was rewritten from the
scratch. The rewriting was originally done by single linguist as usual, in a
master’s thesis project <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">pirinen/2008</span>]</cite>, but afterwards it has been
extended as full-fledged open source project and used in various contexts. This
extended development has made necessary to create a better modularised
framework to allow people of different level of knowledge and familiarity with
finite-state technology and Finnish to contribute on their prospective parts of
the description without causing problems for other applications of the
finite-state analysers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The projects that have used and use omorfi as language description include
spell checking and correction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">pirinen/2010/lrec</span>]</cite>, lemmatizing for IR
applications (e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">kurola/2010</span>]</cite>), named entity recognition, rule-based
machine translation (e.g. Finnish—Northern
SÃ¡mi<span class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><a href="http://apertium.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/apertium/incubator/apertium-sme-fin/" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">http://apertium.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/apertium/incubator/apertium-sme-fin/</a></span></span></span>)
and syntactic disambiguation and analysis. The demands for even the basic
morphology with all these different applications are very different with
regards to productivity; lexical coverage and accuracy as well as depth of
tagging, so it has became obvious that no one lexical automaton will work for
everyone. For this reason the modularisation has to provide easily
configurable options and modifiability for all end-points.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The modularisation of omorfi was based primarily on technological development,
which is the reason why it still maintains some traditional finite-state
morphology distinctions, such as strict separation off morphological
combinatorics (i.e. lexc code) and morphophonological phenomena (i.e.
twolc code). The same is similarly true for new code base, such as one for
training weighted finite-state models; weighting was split to its one
module.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">One of the key points in modular structure here is that we ensure that modifying
will not typically break already working parts, so contributors adding new words
or moving hyphens will not cause problems in other parts of description
as much as possible.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The modularisation scheme we ended up with in finite-state description of
Finnish has grown organically around rather standard description of
finite-state morphology not significantly different from the work of
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">koskenniemi/1983</span>]</cite>. The further developments of modularisation more or
less have followed from development of finite-state technology along years
from initial implementation of omorfi at publication of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">pirinen/2008</span>]</cite>
to its current open source community developed version.</p>

Official version may be at http://dspace.utlib.ee/dspace/handle/10062/16955." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> we give a hierarchical list of abstract
modules implemented in omorfi at the time of writing. As mentioned, the
classical modules of morphotactic combinatorics (i.e. Xerox compatible lexc
language description) and morphophonology (i.e. Xerox compatible twolc
description) is still present. The morphotactic combinatorics has already been
split to sub modules for two reasons. First is primarily practical fact
that code base for morphotactic combinatorics for words of Finnish is huge.
Second and perhaps the more important distinction is the fact that central
and integral part of the life force of morphophonological description of
the all languages is to keep up with constant influx of new lexical items
to the language; neologisms, proper nouns and other coinages. From further
new modules, orthographical variations was implemented to create detached
support for certain obvious variations of Finnish written data, e.g. the
typewriter and SF7-ASCII era digraphs like sh and zh in stead of Å¡ and Å¾
respectively. The hyphenation and syllabification of Finnish language is also
one obvious service for morphological dictionary to provide; for Finnish the
compound boundaries cannot typically be discriminated without a
dictionary <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">linden/2009/nodalida</span>]</cite>. One of the features that has become
rather obvious along years for morphological parsers is the fact that all
computational linguistic applications must require their own very special
version of morphological analysis, so in omorfi we’ve chosen to avoid lock-ins
for any specific type of <em class="ltx_emph">tag sets</em> or morphological analyses so to say,
and instead go for one version of analysis to contain certain superset of all
needed forms and implement finite-state descriptions (i.e. simple rewriting
rules) to provide all of the different analysis styles. The statistical models
is one of recent developments of finite-state technology, and there’s a lot
to offer for language models here so the whole family of weighted finite-state
training and models is also implemented in omorfi as a separate module here,
which for most intents and purposes does work independently of any other part
of the language description.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">3 </span>Implementation</h2>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Here we briefly discuss implementation of modules, mainly to discuss
about practices that help the cooperation. Naturally full discussion of the
modules is found in the documentation of the
system<span class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><a href="http://home.gna.org/omorfi/" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">http://home.gna.org/omorfi/</a></span></span></span>. The system
implementation is harnessing the autotools framework and unix style tools of
HFST to incrementally build the finite-state automata using finite-state
algebra, such as composition to extend them, originally noted even in
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">beesley/2003</span>]</cite>. The crucial thing for this modular approach is that it
can be applied incrementally, each module can be replaced or disabled entirely
at needs of end application, and with autotools framework all this
can be performed by simple command-line switch to <code class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">./configure</code>.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">3.1 </span>Lexical Data—Lexicon and Features of Lexical Items</h3>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The initial part of morphotactics deals with lexicographical data. This is
the part where most modification and cooperation can be used, the lexical items
in language change all the time in introduction of new word forms, and the
expertise needed to extend the lexicon does not require significant expertise
beyond understanding of the language. For this case we provide different entry
formats for new lexical data; csv, XML and so on. The minimal data to enter for
new word form is morphological part of speech, defined in Finnish grammar
as distinction between verb, nominal or non-inflecting particle, additionally a
paradigm classification is typically needed for working inflection and
derivation. While this is facilitated as much as possible, it is still seen as
problematic by part of contributors, so further research for easy lexicon
management is still required.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The other practical example as to why easy modification of lexical data is
crucial is that for example for rule-based machine translation—in our case
apertium—it is useful to establish mapping between lexical units of source
language and target language. For this reason easy access to lexical units
is required for developers of rule-based machine translation units.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Another extension scheme needed is for projects working syntactic parsers based
on morphological language description—an example in Finnish
cases is yet another forthcoming constraint grammar<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">karlsson/1990</span>]</cite> based
analyser. In this case extensions can be also based on purely lexical data,
such as argument structures and ordering for verbs and adpositions. The method
to implement this is currently at preprocessing phase, however it could be
arguably a separate phase, since lexical data can be trivially composed
afterwards.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The various lexical data sources are joined back to traditional lexc format,
which is combined with word stem variation definitions and inflectional data to
produce lexical automaton. This is compose-intersected with morphophonology
descriptions to produce the analyser already; as these parts rarely need
changes beyond bug-fixes and are unlikely to benefit from open source
cooperation beyond initial linguist work, they are still in same form as
traditional finite-state morphology by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">beesley/2003</span>]</cite>, even if it was

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">3.3 </span>Analysis Formats and Sets</h3>

<div id="S3.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Another thing that is quickly obvious for interoperability is that all projects
using morphological analyser, for whatever purpose, require their own analysis
format. Instead of converging to standard we have temporarily solved this by
making our analyser to contain superset of required features at all times, and
providing rules to rewrite the tagsets. The rulesets can be compiled to
finite-state networks and composed like usual. Typical rules are of course
relatively simple contextless rewriting, for example the annotation for
singular nominative is <code class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">+sg+nom</code>, <code class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter"> SG NOM</code> or <code class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">&lt;sg&gt;&lt;nom&gt;</code>, for
different applications, so a simple composition of <code class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">NUM=SG:+sg</code> rule and
<code class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">CASE=NOM:nom</code> is enough for providing the singular nominatives to that
analysis style. Ideally of course this would be solved by using more suitable
abstract data type for the annotations than character string
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">wintner/2008</span>]</cite>, ideally derived from standardized set of features, such as
ISOCat as is also suggested by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">maxwell/2008</span>]</cite>.</p>

to composable finite-state automaton. Incidentally both mapping of typewriter

of i-final diphthong of spoken language are both definable as rule working on

limit features, such as derivation and compounding, and lexical units, such as
archaic or dialectal words. For example for the spell-checker’s error detection
lexicon or information retrieval task compounding and derivation can be largely
allowed, whereas in the spelling correction the suggestions should be relatively
conservative for plausible but non-existing compounds and derivations.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">What we did not address here is the easy way of coupling up-to-date

framework. This topic has already been widely researched by
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">maxwell/2008</span>]</cite>, specifically in case of finite-state language
